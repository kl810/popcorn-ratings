## Overview

**Tech Used:** React, HTML, CSS

Popcorn Ratings is a simple and fun movie app where users can:

- Search for movies by title.

- Rate movies after watching.

- Add movies to a personal "Watched List".

This project demonstrates key React concepts, including:

- useEffect for data fetching and managing side effects.

- API integration to fetch live movie data.

- Custom hooks for cleaner, reusable logic.

The app is designed to provide a smooth user experience for exploring, rating, and keeping track of your movie journey.

## Lessons learned

Through building Popcorn Ratings, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Using `useEffect` effectively for fetching and updating data.

- Handling **async API requests** in React.

- Structuring state with `useState` and lifting state up.

- Creating **custom hooks** to keep code modular and reusable.

- Managing component re-renders for better performance.
